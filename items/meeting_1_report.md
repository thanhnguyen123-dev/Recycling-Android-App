Additional Suggestions:

Devansu: Add a marketplace feature to the recycling app, allowing users to sell recycled items online and find similar items to purchase
1. Duolingo for Sign language
	Concept: An app designed to teach sign language through interactive lessons and games, helping users with hearing impairments or non-verbal learners to communicate more effectively.

	Features: Step-by-step video tutorials, sign language games, daily practice reminders, and a sign language dictionary with a search function.

2. Mind Mapping Tool
	Concept: A simple-to-use mind-mapping app that helps users with dyslexia and other learning disabilities organize their thoughts, ideas, and learning materials visually.

	Features: Easy drag-and-drop interface, voice-to-text input, customizable templates, and the ability to share mind maps with educators or peers.

3. Book reading assistant
	Concept: A web/mobile app to scan any page of a book to quick search for any text. Also, a way to fetch the dictionary meaning of any word by highlighting it. Can also translate the whole page by scanning it
	
	Features: Finding recently searched meanings/phrases, Text translation into diff languages

4. GPT-based study assistant
	Concept: An app that uses a GPT/LLM model that can answer any questions about a particular course (take COMP2100 initially), eg: assign questions, exam paper questions. Basically training that LLM model specifically on the course material of a particular course to improve or assist a student's learning.

	Features: Q&A chat, search functionality for chats, voice-based Q&A functionality. Potential to turn this into a revenue-generating gig/SaaS by offering assistance for different courses taught at ANU
